# \<mockup-instagram\>

A polymer element to mock-up how instagram sponsored posts appear.

## Installation

```
$ bower install --save tim-mehlhorn/mockup-instagram
```

##Usage

This element is designed to mock-up what an Instragram sponsored would look like without have to go through the Ad creation process on Facebook.

Instagram username (title prop), Instagram Icon, and CTA are all properties for the element.

The first img tag within the element will be used as the post image.

The first span tag within the element will be used as the post text copy.
